Project compiled with the following command:
    $(CC) main.c editor.c -o vte -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99

"$(CC)" is a variable that make expands to cc by default.

"-Wall" stands for “all Warnings”, 
gets the compiler to warn you when it sees code in your program that might not technically be wrong, 
but is considered bad or questionable usage of the C language, like using variables before initializing them.

"-Wextra" and "-pedantic" turn on even more warnings. 

"-std=c99" specifies the exact version of the C language standard we’re using, which is C99. 
C99 allows us to declare variables anywhere within a function, whereas 
ANSI C requires all variables to be declared at the top of a function or block.
